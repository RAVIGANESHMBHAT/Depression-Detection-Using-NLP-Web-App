    <h2>Depression in Older Adults: Signs, Symptoms, Treatment</h2>
    <p>Depression can happen to any of us as we age, but there are ways to boost how you feel and make your senior years healthy and happy.

    </p>

    <h2>Signs and symptoms of depression in older adults</h2>
    <p>Recognizing depression in the elderly starts with knowing the signs and symptoms. Depression red flags include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sadness or feelings of despair</li>
        <li>Unexplained or aggravated aches and pains</li>
        <li>Loss of interest in socializing or hobbies</li>
        <li>Feelings of hopelessness or helplessness</li>
        <li>Slowed movement or speech</li>
        <li>Fixation on death; thoughts of suicide</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Causes of depression in older adults</h2>
    <p>As we grow older, we often face significant life changes that can increase the risk for depression. These can include:
    </p>
    <p><b>Health problems.</b> Illness and disability, chronic or severe pain, cognitive decline, damage to your body image due to surgery or sickness can all be contributors to depression.
    </p>
    <p><b>Loneliness and isolation.</b> Factors such as living alone, a dwindling social circle due to deaths or relocation, decreased mobility due to illness or a loss of driving privileges can trigger depression.
    </p>
    <p><b>Reduced sense of purpose.</b> Retirement can bring with it a loss of identity, status, self-confidence, and financial security and increase the risk of depression.  Physical limitations on activities you used to enjoy can also impact your sense of purpose.
    </p>
    <p><b>Fears.</b> These include a fear of death or dying as well as anxiety over financial problems or health issues.
    </p>
    <p><b>Recent bereavements.</b> The death of friends, family members, and pets, or the loss of a spouse or partner are common causes of depression in older adults.
	</p>

    <h2>Dementia vs. depression</h2>
    <p>Never assume that a loss of mental sharpness is just a normal sign of old age. It could be a sign of either depression or dementia, both of which are common in older adults. Depression and dementia share many similar symptoms, including memory problems, sluggish speech and movements, and low motivation, so it can be difficult to tell the two apart.

        <p style="padding-left:30px;color:white;">Is it Depression or Dementia?</p>
    </div>
    <table>
        <th style="background:#009999 ;"><td style="background:#009999 ;">Symptoms of Depression</td>
        <td style="background:#009999 ;">Symptoms of Dementia</td></th>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Mental decline is relatively rapid</td>
            <td>Mental decline happens slowly</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Know the correct time, date, and where you are</td>
            <td>Be confused and disoriented; become lost in familiar locations</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Difficulty concentrating</td>
            <td>Difficulty with short-term memory</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>Language and motor skills are slow, but normal</td>
            <td>Writing, speaking, and motor skills are impaired</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td></td>
            <td>You notice or worry about memory problems</td>
            <td>You don’t notice memory problems or seem to care</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Whether cognitive decline is caused by dementia or depression, it’s important to see a doctor right away. If it’s depression, memory, concentration, and energy will bounce back with treatment. Treatment for dementia will also improve your quality of life. And in some types of dementia, symptoms can be reversed, halted, or slowed.
    </p>
    <h2>Reach out and stay connected</h2>
    <p>If you’re depressed, you may not want to do anything or see anybody. But isolation only makes depression worse. On your own, it can be difficult to maintain perspective and sustain the effort required to beat depression. That’s why support matters—so make an effort to connect to others and limit the time you’re alone. If you can’t get out to socialize, invite loved ones to visit you, or keep in touch over the phone or email.
    </p>
    <p>But remember: digital communication isn’t a replacement for face-to-face contact. Do your best to see people in person on a daily basis. Your mood will thank you! And remember, it’s never too late to build new friendships.

    <p><b>Get out in to the world.</b> Try not to stay cooped up at home all day. Go to the park, take a trip to the hairdresser, have lunch with a friend, visit a museum, or go to a concert or a play.

    <p><b>Volunteer your time.</b> Helping others is one of the best ways to feel better about yourself and expand your social network.

    <p><b>Join a depression support group.</b> Being with others facing the same problems can help reduce your sense of isolation. It can also be inspiring to hear how others cope with depression.

    <p><b>Take care of a pet. A pet can keep you company,</b> and walking a dog, for example, can be good exercise for you and a great way to meet people. Dog owners love to chat while their pets play together.

    <p><b>Take a class or join a club to meet like-minded people.</b> Try joining a senior center, a book club, or another group of people with similar interests.

    <p><b>Create opportunities to laugh.</b> Laughter provides a mood boost, so swap humorous stories and jokes with your loved ones, watch a comedy, or read a funny book.
        
	<h2>Find meaning and purpose in life</h2>
    <p>To overcome depression—and stop it coming back—it’s important to continue to feel engaged and enjoy a strong purpose in life. As we age, life changes and you can lose things that previously occupied your time and gave life its meaning. Retirement, the loss of close friends or loved ones, relocating away from your social network, and changes in your finances, status, or physical health can impact your mood, confidence, and sense of self-worth. But there are still plenty of ways you can find new meaning in life and continue to feel engaged in the world. Sometimes it’s just a matter of reframing how you think of yourself or the aging process.
    </p>
    <p><b>Focus on what you can still do,</b> not what you used to be able to do. Maybe you feel frustrated that you’re not able to do everything you once could, or at least not to the same levels? Or perhaps negative ideas about growing older have dented your self-confidence? Instead of focusing on what you once did, try focusing on the things you can do. You’ll see just how much you still have to offer.

    <p><b>Learn a new skill.</b> Pick something that you’ve always wanted to learn, or that sparks your imagination and creativity—a musical instrument, a foreign language, or a new game or sport, for example. Learning new activities not only adds meaning and joy to life, but can also help to maintain your brain health and prevent mental decline.

    <p><b>Get involved in your community.</b> Try attending a local event, tutoring kids, or volunteering for a cause that’s important to you. Community work can be a great way of utilizing and passing on the skills you honed in your career—without the commitment or stress of regular employment.

    <p><b>Take pride in your appearance.</b> When you retire, it’s easy to let yourself go a little now you don’t have to be at work every day. But putting effort into how you look each morning can give your self-confidence a welcome boost and improve how you feel.

    <p><b>Travel.</b> Once you’re retired and your kids have left home, you likely have more time on your hands to visit the places you’ve always wanted to go. Book a vacation to somewhere new or take a weekend trip to a favorite place. Travel doesn’t have to be extravagant or expensive to boost your mood. Enjoy time in nature by taking a scenic walk or hike, going fishing or camping, or spending a day at the beach.

    <p><b>Write your memoirs,</b> learn to paint, or take up a new craft.

    <p>Everyone has different idea about what brings meaning and purpose to life. The important thing is to find activities that are both meaningful and enjoyable for you. The more you nourish your spirit, the better you’ll feel.
