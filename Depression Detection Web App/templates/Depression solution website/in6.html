    <h2>Understanding depression in women</h2>
    <p>Depression can impact every area of a woman’s life—including your physical health, social life, relationships, career, and sense of self-worth—and is complicated by factors such as reproductive hormones, social pressures, and the unique female response to stress. However, it’s important to know that you’re not alone. Women are about twice as likely as men to suffer from depression but depression is treatable and there are plenty of things you can do to make yourself feel better.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the Catch-22 of depression is that feeling better requires action but taking action when you’re depressed is difficult. However, while you may not have much energy, you probably have enough to take a short walk around the block or pick up the phone to call a loved one, for example—and that can be a great start to boosting your mood and improving your outlook. It’s important to also learn about the factors that cause depression in women so you can tackle the condition head on, treat your depression most effectively, and help prevent it from coming back.
    </p>
    <h2>Signs and symptoms of depression in women</h2>
    <p>The symptoms of depression in women vary from mild to severe (major depression) and are distinguished by the impact they have on your ability to function. Common signs of depression include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. You feel as if nothing will ever get better and there’s nothing you can do to improve your situation.
        </li>
        <li>You don’t care anymore about former hobbies, pastimes, and social activities you used to enjoy.</li>
        <li>Appetite changes often leading to significant weight loss or weight gain.</li>
        <li>Changes in your sleep pattern.</li>
        <li>Feeling angry, agitated, restless.</li>
        <li>Feeling fatigued, sluggish, and drained of energy.</li>
        <li>Trouble concentrating, making decisions, or remembering things.</li>
        <li>Increase in aches and pains, including headaches, cramps, breast tenderness, or bloating.</li>
        <li>Suicidal thoughts.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Women also tend to experience certain depression symptoms more often than men. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Depression in the winter months</b> (seasonal affective disorder) due to lower levels of sunlight.</li>
        <li><b>Symptoms of atypical depression,</b> where rather than sleeping less, eating less, and losing weight, you experience the opposite: sleeping excessively, eating more (especially refined carbohydrates), and gaining weight.</li>
        <li><b>Strong feelings of guilt and worthlessness.</b> You harshly criticize yourself for perceived faults and mistakes.</li>
	</ul>
    <h2>How to feel better tip 1: Reach out for social support</h2>
    <img src="static/images/d9.jpg" width="80%;"/>
    <p>You can make a huge dent in your depression with simple but powerful self-help steps. Feeling better takes time and effort when you don’t feel like making an effort. But you can get there if you make positive choices for yourself each day and draw on the support of others.
    </p><p>Getting support from people who care about you plays an essential role in overcoming depression. On your own, it can be difficult to maintain a healthy perspective and sustain the effort required to beat depression. At the same time, the very nature of depression makes it difficult to reach out for help. When you’re depressed, the tendency is to withdraw and isolate, while an irritable mood brought on by depression can cause you to lash out over situations that wouldn’t normally bother you, further distancing you from others.

    </p><p>Ask for the help and support you need and share what you’re going through with the people you love and trust. You may have neglected your most treasured relationships, but they can get you through this tough time. If you don’t feel that you have anyone to confide in, you can find help to build new friendships—even if you’re shy or introverted.
    </p>
    <h3>How to reach out for support</h3>
    <p><b>Look for support from people who make you feel safe and cared for.</b> The person you talk to doesn’t have to be able to fix you; they just need to be a good listener—someone who’ll listen attentively and compassionately without being distracted or judging you.
    </p>
    <p><b>Make face-time a priority.</b> Phone calls, social media, and texting are great ways to stay in touch, but they don’t replace good old-fashioned in-person quality time. The simple act of talking to someone face to face about how you feel can play a big role in relieving depression and keeping it away.
    </p>
    <p><b>Try to keep up with social activities even if you don’t feel like it.</b> Often when you’re depressed it feels more comfortable to retreat into your shell, but being around other people will make you feel less depressed.
    </p>
    <p><b>Find ways to support others.</b> It’s nice to receive support, but research shows you get an even bigger mood boost from providing support yourself. So, find ways—both big and small—to help others: volunteer, be a listening ear for a friend, do something nice for somebody.
    </p>
    <p><b>Join a support group for depression.</b> Being with others dealing with depression can go a long way in reducing your sense of isolation. You can also encourage each other, give and receive advice on how to cope, and share your experiences.
    </p>
    <h2>Get professional help if needed</h2>
    <p>If you don’t benefit sufficiently from self-help treatments, seek help from a mental health professional. While women suffering from depression respond to the same types of treatment as men, specific aspects of treatment are often modified for women. Women are also more likely to require simultaneous treatment for other conditions such as anxiety or eating disorders.
    </p>
    <p><b>Therapy.</b> Talk therapy is an extremely effective treatment for depression. It can provide you with the skills and insight to relieve depression symptoms and help prevent depression from coming back. One of the most important things to consider when choosing a therapist is your connection with this person. The right therapist will be a caring and supportive partner in your depression treatment and recovery.
    </p>
    <p><b>Medication.</b> Antidepressant medication may help relieve some symptoms of depression in women, but it won’t cure the underlying problem. Because of female biological differences, women are generally started on lower doses of antidepressants than men. Women are also more likely to experience side effects, so any medication use should be closely monitored. Don’t rely on a doctor who is not trained in mental health for guidance on medication, and remember that medication works best when you make healthy lifestyle changes as well.
