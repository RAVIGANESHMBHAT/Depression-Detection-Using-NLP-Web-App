    <h2>Relaxation Techniques for Stress Relief</h2>
    <p>To effectively combat stress, you need to activate your body’s natural relaxation response. Techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, meditation, and yoga can help.
    </p>

    <h2>Finding the best relaxation technique for you</h2>
    <p>For many of us, relaxation means flopping on the couch and zoning out in front of the TV at the end of a stressful day. But this does little to reduce the damaging effects of stress. Rather, you need to activate your body’s natural relaxation response, a state of deep rest that puts the brakes on stress, slows your breathing and heart rate, lowers your blood pressure, and brings your body and mind back into balance. You can do this by practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, rhythmic exercise, yoga, or tai chi.
    </p>
    <p>While you may choose to pay for a professional massage or acupuncture session, for example, most relaxation techniques can be done on your own or with the aid of a free audio download or inexpensive smartphone app. It’s important to remember, however, that there is no single relaxation technique that works for everyone. We’re all different. The right technique is the one that resonates with you, fits your lifestyle, and is able to focus your mind to elicit the relaxation response. That means it may require some trial and error to find the technique (or techniques) that work best for you. Once you do, regular practice can help reduce everyday stress and anxiety, improve your sleep, boost your energy and mood, and improve your overall health and wellbeing.
    </p>
    <h2>Relaxation technique #1: Deep breathing</h2>
    <p>With its focus on full, cleansing breaths, deep breathing is a simple yet powerful relaxation technique. It’s easy to learn, can be practiced almost anywhere, and provides a quick way to get your stress levels in check. Deep breathing is the cornerstone of many other relaxation practices, too, and can be combined with other relaxing elements such as aromatherapy and music. While apps and audio downloads can guide you through the process, all you really need is a few minutes and a place to sit quietly or stretch out.
    </p>
    <h3>How to practice deep breathing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sit comfortably with your back straight. Put one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Breathe in through your nose. The hand on your stomach should rise. The hand on your chest should move very little.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Exhale through your mouth, pushing out as much air as you can while contracting your abdominal muscles. The hand on your stomach should move in as you exhale, but your other hand should move very little.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Continue to breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to inhale enough so that your lower abdomen rises and falls. Count slowly as you exhale.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you find it difficult breathing from your abdomen while sitting up, try lying down. Put a small book on your stomach, and breathe so that the book rises as you inhale and falls as you exhale.
    </p>

    <div style="background:#cce5ff;width:950px;">
        <center><h3 id="tag" style="color:#009999;padding-top:20px;">Why breathe from your belly?</h3></center>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:15px;">Belly breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the head down the neck, through the chest, and to the colon. This activates your relaxation response, reducing your heart rate and blood pressure and lowering stress levels.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>#2: Progressive muscle relaxation</h2>
    <p>Progressive muscle relaxation is a two-step process in which you systematically tense and relax different muscle groups in the body. With regular practice, it gives you an intimate familiarity with what tension—as well as complete relaxation—feels like in different parts of your body. This can help you react to the first signs of the muscular tension that accompanies stress. And as your body relaxes, so will your mind.
    </p>
    <p>Progressive muscle relaxation can be combined with deep breathing for additional stress relief.
    </p>
    <h3>Practicing progressive muscle relaxation</h3>
    <p>Consult with your doctor first if you have a history of muscle spasms, back problems, or other serious injuries that may be aggravated by tensing muscles.
    </p>
    <p>Start at your feet and work your way up to your face, trying to only tense those muscles intended.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Loosen clothing, take off your shoes, and get comfortable.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Take a few minutes to breathe in and out in slow, deep breaths.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">When you’re ready, shift your attention to your right foot. Take a moment to focus on the way it feels.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Slowly tense the muscles in your right foot, squeezing as tightly as you can. Hold for a count of 10.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Relax your foot. Focus on the tension flowing away and how your foot feels as it becomes limp and loose.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Stay in this relaxed state for a moment, breathing deeply and slowly.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Shift your attention to your left foot. Follow the same sequence of muscle tension and release.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">Move slowly up through your body, contracting and relaxing the different muscle groups.
        </li><li style="padding-top:10px;">It may take some practice at first, but try not to tense muscles other than those intended.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>#3: Body scan meditation</h2>
    <p>This is a type of meditation that that focuses your attention on various parts of your body. Like progressive muscle relaxation, you start with your feet and work your way up. But instead of tensing and relaxing muscles, you simply focus on the way each part of your body feels, without labeling the sensations as either “good” or “bad”.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lie on your back, legs uncrossed, arms relaxed at your sides, eyes open or closed. Focus on your breathing for about two minutes until you start to feel relaxed.
        </li><li>Turn your focus to the toes of your right foot. Notice any sensations you feel while continuing to also focus on your breathing. Imagine each deep breath flowing to your toes. Remain focused on this area for three to five seconds (or more).
        </li><li>Move your focus to the sole of your right foot. Tune in to any sensations you feel in that part of your body and imagine each breath flowing from the sole of your foot. After one or two minutes, move your focus to your right ankle and repeat. Move to your calf, knee, thigh, hip, and then repeat the sequence for your left leg. From there, move up the torso, through the lower back and abdomen, the upper back and chest, and the shoulders. Pay close attention to any area of the body that causes you pain or discomfort.
        </li><li>After completing the body scan, relax for a while in silence and stillness, noting how your body feels. Then slowly open your eyes and stretch, if necessary.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>#4: Mindfulness meditation</h2>
    <p>Mindfulness has become extremely popular in recent years, garnering headlines and endorsements from celebrities, business leaders, and psychologists alike. So, what is mindfulness? Rather than worrying about the future or dwelling on the past, mindfulness switches your focus to what’s happening right now, enabling you to be fully engaged in the present moment.
    </p>
    <p>Meditations that cultivate mindfulness have long been used to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and other negative emotions. Some of these practices bring you into the present by focusing your attention on a single repetitive action, such as your breathing or a few repeated words. Other forms of mindfulness meditation encourage you to follow and then release internal thoughts or sensations. Mindfulness can also be applied to activities such as walking, exercising, or eating.
    </p>
    <p>Using mindfulness to stay focused on the present might seem straightforward, but it takes practice to reap all the benefits. When you first start practicing, you’ll likely find that your focus keeps wandering back to your worries or regrets. But don’t get disheartened. Each time you draw your focus back to the present, you’re strengthening a new mental habit that can help you break free of fretting about the past or stressing about the future. Using an app or audio download can also help focus your attention, especially when you’re starting out.
    </p>

    <h2>#5: Yoga and tai chi</h2>
    <img src="static/images/d13.jpg" width="70%;"/>
    <p>Yoga involves a series of both moving and stationary poses, combined with deep breathing. As well as reducing anxiety and stress, yoga can also improve flexibility, strength, balance, and stamina. Since injuries can happen when yoga is practiced incorrectly, it’s best to learn by attending group classes, hiring a private teacher, or at least following video instructions. Once you’ve learned the basics, you can practice alone or with others, tailoring your practice as you see fit.
    </p>

    <div style="background:#cce5ff;width:950px;">
        <center><h3 id="tag" style="color:#009999;padding-top:20px;">What type of yoga is best for stress?</h3></center>
        <hr>
        <p style="padding-left:10px;padding-bottom:15px;">Although almost all yoga classes end in a relaxation pose, classes that emphasize slow, steady movement, deep breathing, and gentle stretching are best for stress relief.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Satyananda</b> is a traditional form of yoga. It features gentle poses, deep relaxation, and meditation, making it suitable for beginners as well as anyone aiming primarily for stress reduction.
            </li><li><b>Hatha yoga</b> is also a reasonably gentle way to relieve stress and is suitable for beginners. Alternately, look for labels like gentle, for stress relief, or for beginners when selecting a yoga class.
            </li><li style="padding-bottom:20px;"><b>Power yoga,</b> with its intense poses and focus on fitness, is better suited to those looking for stimulation as well as relaxation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>If you’re unsure whether a specific yoga class is appropriate for stress relief, call the studio or ask the teacher.</p>

    <h3>Tai chi</h3>
    <p>If you’ve seen a group of people in the park slowly moving in synch, you’ve likely witnessed tai chi. Tai chi is a self-paced series of slow, flowing body movements. By focusing your mind on the movements and your breathing, you keep your attention on the present, which clears the mind and leads to a relaxed state.
    </p>
    <p>Tai chi is a safe, low-impact option for people of all ages and fitness levels, including older adults and those recovering from injuries. As with yoga, it’s best learned in a class or from a private instructor. Once you’ve learned the basics, you can practice alone or with others.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips for starting a relaxation practice</h2>
    <p>Learning the basics of these relaxation techniques isn’t difficult, but it takes regular practice to truly harness their stress-relieving power. Try setting aside at least 10 to 20 minutes a day for your relaxation practice.
    </p>
    <p><b>Set aside time in your daily schedule.</b> If possible, schedule a set time once or twice a day for your practice. If your schedule is already packed, try meditating while commuting on the bus or train, taking a yoga or tai chi break at lunchtime, or practicing mindful walking while exercising your dog.
    </p>
    <p><b>Make use of smartphone apps and other aids.</b> Many people find that smartphone apps or audio downloads can be useful in guiding them through different relaxation practices, establishing a regular routine, and keeping track of progress.
    </p>
    <p><b>Expect ups and downs.</b> Sometimes it can take time and practice to start reaping the full rewards of relaxation techniques such as meditation. The more you stick with it, the sooner the results will come. If you skip a few days or even a few weeks, don’t get discouraged. Just get started again and slowly build up to your old momentum.
